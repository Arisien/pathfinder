Pathfinder is a C++ program which searches for the ideal path from point A to B in within a 2 dimensional character vector. Walls are denoted with hashtags while empty spaces are marked with the space character. The program will mark the distance of all reachable points on the map from the starting position. If the goal position is reachable it will then backtrace to the starting position and find the best move to reach the goal in the least amount of steps.

## Usage

The path to your goal destination can be found by calling the pathfinder function. Its parameters are the character vector containing the map, the starting position, and the ending position. Positions are simple objects containing public x and y integer properties. The pathfinder will return a Path object. The following is a sample use of the pathfinding function:

```cpp
#include "pathfinder.hpp"

using namespace Pathfinder;

int main (void) {
  Position start = Position(0,0);
  Position goal = Position(5,6);

  Path path = pathfinder(generateMap(8,8, start, goal), start, goal);

  path.print();

  return 0;
}
```

The Path objects contains information about the pathfinding attempt. It has the inputed starting and goal positions, whether or not the goal is reachable, the length of the path (labeled distance), and a vector containing the sequence of moves used to reach the goal position. The following is the sample output:

```
$ 1 2 3 4 5 . .
# # # . # 6 . .
# . . # . 7 . #
. . . . . 8 9 0
# # # # # # # 1
# # . # # . . 2
. # . . . X 4 3
. . . . . . # .

Starting Position: [0, 0]
Goal: [5, 6]
Distance: 15
Suggested Move: Right
```

The map is drawn with $ being the starting position and X being the goal. The information about the path below is printed to console when path.print() is called.

## Documentation

* `Path pathfinder (std::vector<std::vector<char>> map, Position start, Position goal)`

This is the pathfinding function which requires the map, as well as starting and goal positions. It calls on the recursive pathfind() function to create a depth map of how far away each tile is from the starting position and then backtracks to find the ideal path from start to finish. It will return a Path object containing all relevant data.

* `std::vector<std::vector<char>> generateMap (int height, int width, Position start, Position goal)`

Pass the width, height, starting position, and goal position. The function will return a randomly generated map where the start and goal positions are not walls.

* `class Position`

Position is a class used to represent a 2D position in the vector. It has 2 integer instance variable x and y. The toString() function may be called to display a position in the following format: [X, Y].

* `class Path`

Path is a class containing information of a pathfinding attempt. `path.possible` is a boolean which states whether or not the goal can be reached or if it is blocked by walls. `path.start` and `path.goal` are the starting and goal positions of the pathfinding attempt. `path.distance` is and integer which stores how far away the goal is from the starting position. `path.moves` contains a vector of positions in order to reach the goal position. `path.levels` contains a 2D integer vector with depths of how far away each point is from starting position. Unreachable points are assigned with the maximum integer limit, while walls are assigned -1. `path.print()` prints the information about the path to the console.

## Building

*Note: a C++ compiler is required to run the program. Alternatively download the binaries from releases*

* Compile the source file within the source directory: `g++ test.cpp`
* Run pathfinder by running the created binary: `./a.out`

## Todo

* Clean up code
* Map files
